2)    Predicted throughput: L1 L2 L3 L4 = 15.5Mpbs
      Predicted latency: sum of latency in L1 L2 L3 L4 = 13+13+23+85 = 134 ms
      Actual throughput: 15.4 Mbps
      Actual latency: 137.565 ms
      Explanation of results: same prediciton. 

3.1)  Predicted throughput: 7.7Mpbs (half of q2 in actual throughput)
      Predicted latency: 137.565 ms (same as q2 in actual latency)
      Actual throughput: h2 - h7: 7.10Mpbs, h1 - h9: 8.69Mpbs
      Actual latency: h2 - h7: 139.589 ms, h1 - h9: 137.843ms
      Explanation of results: For the latency, not the same prediction time of the ping are fluctuated. some icmp_seq will delay. And make the average latency are not same with the prediction.
							  For the throughtput, not the same prediction,  but it is near the prediction. it is because there are some factor like latency unstable will affect throughtput.								 

3.2)  Predicted throughput: near to Q2 actual throughput 15.4/3 = 5.13Mbps
      Predicted latency:	near to Q2 actual latency 137.565
      Actual throughput:	h2 - h7: 4.07Mbps, h1 - h9: 4.87Mbps, h5 - h6: 5.35Mbps  
      Actual latency:		h2 - h7: 140.927 ms, h1 - h9: 138.739ms, h5 - h6: 136.577ms
      Explanation of results: For the latency, it is near to the prediction. actually, I tried lots in this latency test. I think the delay of hit ENTER affect the latency difference.
							  For the throughput, it is near to the prediction. The delay of hit ENTER affect the throughput difference

4)    Predicted throughput: since L_3 bandwidth is 15Mbps. and each throughput of each connection would be find the smallest bandwidth they have shared. therefore, h1-h9 and h3-h8 share 15Mbps. And one thoughput would be higher than 15/2 = 7.5mbps, one would be lower than 7.5 Mbps.
 	  Predicted latency:	~137.565 ms in h1 - h9 and 13 + 23 = ~36ms in h3 - h8 
      Actual throughput:	h1 - h9: 5.72Mbps, h3 - h8: 14.3Mbps
      Actual latency:		h1 - h9: 130.269ms, h3 - h8: 35.491ms
      Explanation of results: For the throughput, it is smiliar to my prediction.
							  For the latency, it is similiar to my prediction.
5)    Explanation of results:
							HK: 47.7ms (cuhk)
							CN: 27.0ms (baidu)
							US: 31.7ms	(google)
							there are some different between connecting to 3 destination. maybe it affected by the CPU and RAM 
							processing.  expecially, my testing is in the VM.
